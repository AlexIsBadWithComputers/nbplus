# nbplus

A collection of classes and methods for Creators with intent to enable greater interactivity and visual aesthetic in Jupyter notebooks.

## Getting Started

All submodules are installed from the `staging` branch via

`pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall --user git+git://github.com/callysto/nbplus.git@staging#egg=nbplus`. 

Once installed, submodules may be imported separately.

e.g.

```python
import nblayout.uiButtons
from nbvis.ggb import *
```

## Contributing

Create and develop upon a new branch to contribute. Push merge requests to the `staging` branch.

Well-behaved objects are aptly named (_what does the object do?_) and readily expose effective code so that incoming learners may transparently access their underlying functionality.
