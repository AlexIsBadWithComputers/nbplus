# nbplus

A collection of classes and methods for Creators with intent to enable greater interactivity and visual aesthetic in Jupyter notebooks.

Well-behaved objects are aptly named (i.e. what does the object do?) and readily expose effective code so that incoming learners may transparently access their underlying functionality.
