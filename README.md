# nbplus

[nbplus](https://github.com/callysto/nbplus) (working title) a collection of Callysto-made Python modules for Creators wanting greater interactivity and visual aesthetic in Jupyter notebooks. The tools here reflect a desire for aggregation of reusable code and uniformity in how we develop interactive content.

## Getting Started

All submodules are installed via the command line using

`pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall --user git+git://github.com/callysto/nbplus.git#egg=nbplus`.

Once installed, submodules may be imported separately.

e.g.

```python
import nblayout.uiButtons
from nbvis.ggb import *
```

See the [training manual]() for documentation and use cases.

## Contributing

Create and develop upon a new branch to contribute. Push merge requests to the `staging` branch.

Well-behaved objects are aptly named (_what does the object do?_) and readily expose effective code so that incoming learners may transparently access their underlying functionality.
