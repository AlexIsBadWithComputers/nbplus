# Getting Started
To use the tagging extension go to _setup.ipynb_ and run the cell labeled "Activate". Now there will be a new button on the tool bar of any .ipynb file you open, use it to modify the notebook metadata.

To use the tag browser go to _browser/Browse.ipynb_ and run it. Note: It will only look for files in the same directory and any directory below it.
